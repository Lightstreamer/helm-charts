  <!--
    The following is the base logger of all logging messages printed by
    Lightstreamer Kernel (with a few exceptions).

    Messages logged at INFO level notify major server activities,
    like session starting and ending. If these messages are enabled,
    they are also supplied to the internal MONITOR data adapter,
    together with WARN and ERROR messages.

    Messages logged at DEBUG level notify minor operations
    and all data flow inside the Server. They should not be enabled
    with production load levels.
    No useful messages are logged at TRACE level. The level is reserved
    for debug versions of the Server.

    Severe ERROR messages are logged with a "FATAL" marker; in fact, a FATAL
    level is not natively supported by logback.
    Thanks to the marker, these messages can be filtered through logback's
    MarkerFilter.
    By the factory pattern configuration, FATAL is logged instead of ERROR
    for these messages (note the tricky "%-5.5(%p%marker)" pattern).

    These two loggers are used by the internal monitoring system to log
    load statistics at INFO level.
    LightstreamerMonitorText logs statistics with a human-readable syntax;
    LightstreamerMonitorTAB logs statistics with a CSV syntax.

    The frequency of the samples produced by the internal monitoring system
    is governed by the <collector_millis> configuration element.
    However, a resampling to lower frequencies can be performed, based on the
    level specified for each logger; in particular:
      at TRACE level, all samples are logged;
      at DEBUG level, one sample out of 10 is logged;
      at INFO level, one sample out of 60 is logged;
      at a higher level, no log is produced.
    The resampling behavior can be changed at runtime, by changing the level;
    however, if the level is set to ERROR on startup, the logger will be
    disabled throughout the life of the Server, regardless of further changes.

    When resampling is in place, note that, for each displayed sample, values
    that are supposed to be averaged over a timeframe still refer to the
    current sample's timeframe (based on <collector_millis>); however, values
    that are supposed to be the maximum over all timeframes refer also to the
    samples that were not displayed.
    On the other hand, delta statistics, like "new connections", are always
    collected starting from the previous logged sample.
