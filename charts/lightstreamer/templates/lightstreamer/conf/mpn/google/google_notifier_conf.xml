        notifications for the same app/device pair. Each app/device

        notifications may be sent to it. For this reason, a minimum

        frequency, may cause Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service ("FCM")
        to close the connection and ban (temporarily or permanently) any
        successive notification.
        Mobile push notifications fired by a trigger are not subject to

      <!-- Optional. Specifies the list of trigger expressions that will be
           accepted. Each <accept> element is a Java-compatible regular expression
           (see java.util.regex.Pattern): triggers requested via client APIs will
           be compared with each regular expression, and accepted only if there
           is at least one match.
           Remember that the MPN Module supports, as trigger, any Java boolean
           expression, including use of JDK classes and methods, with the addition
           of field references syntax (see the iOS Client SDK for more information).
           Hence, this check is a safety measure required to avoid that clients
           can request triggers potentially dangerous for the Server, as each
           trigger may contain arbitrary Java code.
           If left commented out or empty, no triggers will be accepted.
           Please note that using an "accept all" regular expression like .*
           is possible, but still leaves the Server exposed to the danger of
           maliciously crafted triggers. Anyway, the Metadata Adapter has a second
           chance to check for trigger allowance.
           The example shown below is for a typical notification on threshold,
           where a field is compared against a numeric constant.
           Note: submitted trigger expressions are compared with this list of
           regular expressions after their named-arguments have been converted
           to indexed-arguments. Always specify fields with the "$[digits]" format,
           not the "${name}" format. -->
